## üîç Step 1: Analyze the Project Requirements

1. Social Platform with Millions of Users  
   - Implication: High data volume and concurrency  
   - Need: Horizontal scalability and high availability  

2. Data Types: Profiles, Posts, Connections  
   - Profiles: Semi-structured  
   - Posts: Content + timestamps (feeds)  
   - Connections: Graph relationships  

3. High Read Performance  
   - Optimize for fast, low-latency queries  

4. 80% Reads / 20% Writes  
   - Read-optimized design needed (caching, replication, indexing)  

5. Scalability  
   - Must support rapid growth‚Äîscale-out preferred

## üìö Step 2: Map Requirements to Database Models

Evaluated models:  
1. Relational (RDBMS)  
2. Document Store (MongoDB)  
3. Wide Column Store (Cassandra)  
4. Graph DB (Neo4j)  
5. Search Engine DB (Elasticsearch)

## üîé Step 3: Evaluate Trade-offs for Each Model

1. **RDBMS**  
   - Pros: Strong consistency, SQL support  
   - Cons: Poor at massive scale with graph queries  
   - Verdict: Not optimal  

2. **MongoDB**  
   - Pros: Good for semi-structured data (profiles/posts), scalable, fast reads  
   - Cons: Weak in graph querying  
   - Verdict: Strong for profiles and posts  

3. **Cassandra**  
   - Pros: High throughput, time-series friendly  
   - Cons: Complex joins/traversals are hard  
   - Verdict: Good for posts/feed storage  

4. **Neo4j**  
   - Pros: Ideal for user connections/graph traversal  
   - Cons: Not as scalable for high-volume reads  
   - Verdict: Best for user connections  

5. **Elasticsearch**  
   - Pros: Excellent for search and ranked feed  
   - Cons: Not a primary data store  
   - Verdict: Useful as a secondary system

## üß† Step 4: Compose a Multi-Database Architecture (Polyglot Persistence)

| Use Case             | Database      | Reason                                          |
|----------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| User Profiles         | MongoDB       | Semi-structured, fast reads                     |
| Posts / Feeds         | Cassandra     | Scalable, fast for reads/writes, time-ordered   |
| User Connections      | Neo4j         | Graph traversal and social structure analysis   |
| Feed Search/Ranking   | Elasticsearch | Full-text and ranked query capabilities         |

## ‚úÖ Final Decision

**Recommended Architecture**:  
Use a combination of **MongoDB**, **Cassandra**, **Neo4j**, and optionally **Elasticsearch**.

This approach ensures:
- Scalability  
- High read performance  
- Appropriate modeling for structured, semi-structured, and graph data  
- Clean separation of responsibilities across data models
