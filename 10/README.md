## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have:

1. **Python 3.7 or higher** installed on your system
   - Check version: `python --version`
   - Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. **OpenAI API Key**
   - Sign up at: https://platform.openai.com/
   - Navigate to API Keys section
   - Create a new API key
   - Keep it secure - you'll need it when running the application

3. **Command Line Access**
   - Windows: Command Prompt or PowerShell
   - macOS/Linux: Terminal

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Navigate to the Project Directory

Open your command line and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
# Windows
cd D:\edu-ai-challenge-2025\10

# macOS/Linux (adjust path as needed)
cd /path/to/edu-ai-challenge-2025/10
```

### Step 2: Verify Required Files

Ensure all required files are present:
- `product_search.py` (main application)
- `products.json` (product database)
- `requirements.txt` (dependencies)

```bash
# List files to verify
dir          # Windows
ls -la       # macOS/Linux
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**If you encounter issues:**
- Try using `pip3` instead of `pip`
- On some systems, use `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- If permission errors occur, try `pip install --user -r requirements.txt`

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Test if dependencies are installed correctly:

```bash
python -c "from openai import OpenAI; print('Installation successful!')"
```

### Getting Help

If you continue to experience issues:
1. Verify all prerequisites are met
2. Check that all files are in the correct location
3. Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
4. Try the example queries provided above

## How It Works

1. **Input Processing**: The tool accepts natural language input from the user
2. **AI Analysis**: OpenAI's gpt-4.1-mini model analyzes the input and extracts filtering criteria
3. **Function Calling**: The extracted criteria are passed to a filtering function using OpenAI's function calling feature
4. **Product Filtering**: Products are filtered based on the AI-extracted criteria (no manual filtering logic)
5. **Results Display**: Matching products are displayed in a structured format

## Technical Details

- **Model Used**: gpt-4.1-mini with function calling
- **Function Schema**: Supports category, max_price, min_price, min_rating, in_stock_only, and keywords filters
- **Security**: API key is requested each time and not stored in code
- **Data Source**: Local products.json file with 50 sample products
- **Output Format**: Structured list with product name, price, rating, and stock status

## Important Notes

- **Security**: The application prompts for your OpenAI API key each time for security reasons
- **No Manual Filtering**: All filtering is done through OpenAI function calling as required
- **Data Source**: The tool uses the products.json file as its product database
- **Exit Commands**: Type 'quit', 'exit', or 'q' to exit the application
- **API Costs**: Each query uses OpenAI API credits (typically very small cost per query)
